## Publications

## Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Key Point Matching (EMNLP 2021)

```
International Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2021
```
- Achieved the best MAP score of 0.9096 and 2nd place on the global leaderboard, for the identification and ranking of relevant key points
- Designed and implemented a pre-trained language model-based architecture to predict the match score for key point and argument pairs
- Improved the MAP by adding syntactic features such as POS Tags, TFIDF scores, and data augmentation using external datasets

## Compositional Committees of Tiny Networks (ICONIP 2021)

```
28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing
```
Advisor - Prof. Tomas Maul

- Designed and implemented a new form of compositional ensembles that speeds up computations in deep neural networks
- Achieved an increase in speed by25.7times in a standard CPU setup as compared to 6-layered CNN without any reduction in accuracy
- SurpassedMLP-Mixer(SOTA) in terms of speed by exploiting the composition of the hidden representations of classifiers

## Fine-grained Intent Classification in the Legal Domain (AAAI 2022)

```
36th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
```
- Proposed a new dataset in the Legal Domain for the task of fine-grained as well as coarse-grained intent classification
- Achieved an accuracy score of0.74for the task of document classification by leveraging Pre-trained Language Models such asDeBERTa
- Established a concrete baseline with an accuracy score of0.902for fine-grained intent classification usingJointBERT

## Internship and Research Experience
