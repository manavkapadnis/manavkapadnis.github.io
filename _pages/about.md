I am a Fifth-year Dual Degree Undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering , Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I am also an undergraduate researcher at the  [Complex Networks Research Group](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/), IIT Kharagpur under the supervision of  [Prof. Pawan Goyal](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/) and [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/) . I am currently working on Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language Pretraining for Medical VQA. If you have any ideas that you would like to collaborate, hit me up!
<!-- I was fortunate to intern at Adobe Research, India. I was also selected for IUSSTF-Viterbi program and got the oppotunity to intern at INK-Lab, University of Southern California. -->
