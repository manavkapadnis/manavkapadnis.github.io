Hello ! I’m currently in my first year of graduate studies, pursuing a Master’s degree in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) at the Language Technologies Institute within the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

Before CMU, I completed an Integrated Dual Degree(B.Tech+M.Tech) from the Department of Electrical Engineering , Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I am also worked as an undergraduate researcher at the  [Complex Networks Research Group](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/), IIT Kharagpur under the supervision of  [Prof. Pawan Goyal](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/) and [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~niloy/) . If you have any ideas that you would like to collaborate, hit me up!
<!-- I was fortunate to intern at Adobe Research, India. I was also selected for IUSSTF-Viterbi program and got the oppotunity to intern at INK-Lab, University of Southern California. -->
